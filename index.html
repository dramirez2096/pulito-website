                    <h2>We bet you're wondering: "What is Pulito?"</h2>
                    <p>Excellent question! Pulito is a mobile application that looks to do something about the waste problem plaguing our beautiful planet. Pulito was developed by a team of brilliant and talented developers and designers who noticed a need for an easy to use application that provided people with information on local recycling centers and landfills. Pulito looks to provide users with this information and more! Our actions affect this planet which indirectly affects not only us humans, but also every living being we share this planet with. It is our belief here at Pulito that it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that our environment remains clean for years to come.</p>

                <h2>We bet you're also thinking: "Wow, Pulito sounds awesome! What can I do with it?" </h2>
                <div class="feat-list">
                    <div class="feat-col">
                        <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt fa-3x"></i>
                        <p>
                            Pulito provides users with an interactive map of their city which shows them location and other important information on local landfills and recycling centers. This way users know where to take their waste rather than dump it around the city. Weâ€™ve also included the option to view the information as a list (in case you hate maps).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feat-col">
                        <i class="fas fa-comment fa-3x"></i>
                        <p>
                            Pulito also allows users to create reports of waste around the city. Our hope is that this feature encourages ordinary citizens and non profits to go out and clean up this waste. This feature can also be used to alert other users of dumped items that can potentially be taken to a recycling center or landfill in exchange for money.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feat-col">
                        <i class="fas fa-chart-pie fa-3x"></i>
                        <p>
                            Users can take a picture of their receipt that they obtain after recycling and Pulito takes that data and populates it into a nifty little graph that lets users see just how much they have impacted our environment. We hope this feature will motivate people to recycle by providing them with a visual of their impact on the environment.
